# FF8Calculator
A program designed to calculate statistics and probability for certain abilities and stats.

Things left to do
-----------------------
- Some enemies have fixed levels.  Default "Override" to the fixed level in this case
- Adjust Ultimecia's range so her max is +1 level higher than regular.
- Add stat for "Chance of at least 1 crit with X number of hits for irvine limit"
